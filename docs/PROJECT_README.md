## Deployment

### Recommended Deployment Setup

**Backend:** Render (with PostgreSQL)  
**Frontend:** Vercel  
**Estimated Cost:** $10-15/month for PostgreSQL

### Backend Deployment (Render)

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Create New Web Service on Render
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn config.wsgi:application`
5. Create PostgreSQL database on Render
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy and run migrations

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure project:
   - **Framework Preset:** Vite
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
3. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = Backend URL
4. Deploy

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env):**
```
SECRET_KEY=<50-character-random-string>
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.onrender.com,your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
DATABASE_URL=<postgres-url>
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<50-character-random-string>
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
```

**Frontend (.env.production):**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
```

### Post-Deployment Steps

1. Run database migrations
2. Create superuser account
3. Create test users and roles
4. Setup gamification system
5. Configure LeetCode sync cron job
6. Test all API endpoints
7. Verify CORS configuration
8. Test file upload functionality

## Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. Always work in feature branches, never push directly to `main`
2. Create descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/hackathon-reminders`)
3. Write clear commit messages
4. Test thoroughly before pushing
5. Create pull requests for review
6. Update documentation for new features

### Code Standards

**Frontend (React):**
- Use functional components with hooks

- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components modular and reusable

**Backend (Django):**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Write docstrings for all functions
- Use Django best practices
- Add proper validation and error handling
- Write unit tests for new features

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify API endpoints with Swagger
- Test cross-browser compatibility

### Documentation

- Update README.md for major changes
- Document new API endpoints
- Add comments for complex code
- Update environment variable documentation
- Create user guides for new features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors:**
- Verify `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend settings
- Check frontend is using correct API URL
- Ensure no trailing slashes in URLs

**Authentication Errors:**

- Verify token is sent in Authorization header
- Test login at Django admin panel

**File Upload Errors:**
- Maximum file size: 10MB per file
- Maximum files per request: 10 files
- Allowed types: PDF, images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)

**Database Errors:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials in .env
- Ensure migrations are up to date

**Frontend Build Errors:**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `npm install`
- Clear Vite cache: `npm run clean`
- Check Node.js version compatibility

### Getting Help

- Check documentation files in the repository
- Review API documentation at `/api/docs/`
- Check Django admin panel for data verification
- Review browser console for frontend errors
- Check Django server logs for backend errors
